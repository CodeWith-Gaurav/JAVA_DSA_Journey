# 📘 JAVA_DSA_journey

Welcome to my Java Data Structures and Algorithms journey 🚀.  
This repository is dedicated to documenting my learning and progress as I complete the [DSA Bootcamp by Kunal Kushwaha](https://github.com/kunal-kushwaha/DSA-Bootcamp-Java).

---

## 🎯 Goal

To **complete** the entire Java DSA curriculum — no skipping, no restarting.  
This time it's not just about learning, it's about **finishing what I started** 💪.

---

## 📚 Contents

Each topic/module will have its own folder with:
- 📁 Java source code
- 📝 README with explanations and key concepts (to be added)
- ✅ Solved problems from assignments and practice

### 📂 Folder Structure
```bash
JAVA_DSA_journey/
├── 01_Basics/
├── 02_Conditionals_Loops/
├── ...
├── 14_DynamicProgramming/
└── 15_Revision/

## 📌 Notes

- This repository is created **only for educational purposes**.
- I'm learning and improving as I go — so contributions, suggestions, and corrections are always welcome!
- Each folder will eventually contain:
  - Java source files related to the topic
  - A dedicated `README.md` explaining core concepts and logic
  - Solutions to practice problems or assignments from Kunal Kushwaha's course
